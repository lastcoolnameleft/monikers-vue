# Sobriquet

My attempt at an online version of the popular party game [Monikers](http://www.monikersgame.com/) during this crazy pandemic.

## Building and running on localhost

Window #1 - Backend

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lastcoolnameleft/sobriquet.git
cd sobriquet/server
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

Window #2 - Frontend

```sh
cd sobriquet/client
npm install
npm run start-dev
```

In your browser, go to: http://localhost:8080/
